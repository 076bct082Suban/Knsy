		<h1>Unparalleled Service Amid COVID-19</h1>
		<p class="lead">Shopping for groceries and vital products cannot be avoided even during pandemic like this one but there is constant fear of virus transmission upon visiting the grocery stores. Hence, we came up with this idea of contactless shopping.
			<br> Just order your items and get a unique code. Go to the nearby shop and safely get your item upon showing the code.<br> Thank you!</p>
